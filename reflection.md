# majorproject reflection

## advice for myself

- Better Time Management
- More Organization
- A defined, planned out vision

## the hardest part
Taking way longer than it should have, the 'TextSystem' was probably the hardest part. 
I was too picky with how I wanted it to be, and even if it works, the time spent wasn't
worth it compared to other 'must haves'.

## was the 'must haves' completed?
No.

## was there problems that couldn't be solved?
My own disorganization.
