# Major Project Proposal

## Description

An extension to p5.js that uses ascii text to draw instead of pixels. I plan to make it as simple as possible to use, and I will make a template and documentation so that others can make projects with it. I may have seperate 2D and 3D versions of the extension, that remains to be seen.

## Must have list

- [x] working line function
- [x] filled primitive polygons (triangle, rectangle, circle, maybe ellipse);
- [x] background function
- [x] fill function
- [x] stroke function
- [x] support for either character specific "colours" OR a gradient of ascii characters based on their apparent density
- [x] basic text function

## Nice to have list

- [ ] GOOD line function
- [x] camera input
- [ ] text function with some kind of font (not just plain text)
- [ ] thick lines (strokeWeight)
- [ ] rotate function
- [x] translate function
- [ ] bezier curves
- [x] text box function
- [ ] push/pop functions
- [ ] vscode snippet extension
- [ ] support for 3d primitives, mainly cube
- [ ] support for 3d models (this could be a stretch, but I do have a while to work on it), the timeline of which would look like:
    - [ ] basic wireframe
    - [ ] wireframe with culling
    - [ ] shading with surface normals
    - [ ] smooth shading with interpolation
- [ ] gpu support

## Projects to do once I am satisfied with the ascii engine:

### All of these are just tentative ideas, subject to change

- Double pendulum
- Fluid simulation of some kind (lattice-boltzmann perhaps?)
- Various cellular automata
- Maze game
- Minesweeper
- Snake (again)
- Some kind of soft body physics
- Raycaster
- Mandelbrot visualizer
