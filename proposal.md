# majorproject proposal

## project description
Putting together everything I've learned, I'm going to make a 'Digital Pet' Game, something similar to 'Tamagotchi', or of the sort. I plan to build something relatively simple that can be built off of, and expanded easily, basically a simple, but solid base to then expand into nice-to-have features.

## list of must haves
#### the basics of a tamagotchi
- [x] system clock support
- [ ] input player name (and birthday?) 
- [x] creature hatching or (forming) after a certain period
- [x] creature name
- [ ] creature birthday based on system clock
- [ ] food to feed the creature
- [ ] hunger meter
- [ ] death support
- [ ] variety of music
- [ ] sound effects

## list of nice haves
#### my own ideas and some tamagotchi ones
- [ ] randomly generated creatures (with noise?)
- [ ] random favourite foods
- [ ] happiness meter (you can pet the creature)
- [ ] toys for the creature (affects happiness meter)
- [ ] activities, minigames like swimming or walking
- [ ] day and night cycle (changes page appearance based on system clock)
- [ ] weather cycle (based on local weather?)
- [ ] minigames

## project ideas with extra time
#### small ideas to put into a minigame/arcadelike feature
- expanded/finished versions of my first 3 projects?
- battle mode (like digimon üëç)
- competitions (like chao garden or nintendogs)
